Gen-AI is a powerful subset of AI focused on creating new content, whether text, images, audio, or even videos.

Machine learning (ML) is a branch of computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to enable AI to imitate how humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy. (Learn and improve from experience)

Definition of Machine Learning by Tom Mitchell:
A subset of AI algorithms which learn without being explicitly programmed with rules. Use data to learn and match patterns ~ Tom Mitchell

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised
2. Unsupervised
3. Reinforcement

Deep Learning: Deep learning is a method in artificial intelligence (AI) that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
The functionality of artificial neurons is inspired by the human brain

Difference Between Black&White and Grayscale Images

Black and White Images
Definition: Also known as binary images, these images contain only two colours: black and white.
Colour Depth: Each pixel in a black-and-white image can only be either black (0) or white (1), representing two levels of brightness.
Usage: Often used for simple graphics, text, or high-contrast images where colour is not necessary.

Grayscale Images
Definition: Grayscale images contain shades of grey, ranging from black to white.
Colour Depth: These images typically use 8 bits per pixel, allowing for 256 different shades of grey (from 0, which is black, to 255, which is white).
Usage: Grayscale images are common in photography, medical imaging, and other applications where a range of brightness levels is important for detail.


Deep Learning:
ANN - Artificial Neural Network (used for tabular data/structured data)
CNN - Convolutional Neural Network (used for images and videos)
RNN - Recurrent Neural Network ()

Difference between object detection and object recognition:
Object detection involves identifying and localizing objects with bounding boxes, and providing detailed information about their presence and location. Object recognition focuses on categorizing objects without the need for precise localization.
