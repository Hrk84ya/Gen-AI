## Introduction
Generative AI focuses on creating new content like text, images, audio, and videos using advanced machine learning algorithms. This project covers foundational concepts, practical applications, and neural network implementations.

## Key Topics
- Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning.
- Deep Learning: Architectures such as CNN, RNN, and LSTM.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Text processing techniques and challenges.

## Applications
Generative AI is widely used in:
- Virtual assistants (e.g., Siri)
- Recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix)
- Autonomous driving (e.g., Tesla, Waymo)
- Chatbots and more

## Code Examples
This repository includes basic examples of feed-forward neural networks, CNN, and RNN architectures. See the code folder for more.

# Simple Neural Network Example
model.add(Dense(16, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
```
